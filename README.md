<p> what is code ? </p>
<p>A Program , often referred to as source code or just code , is a set of special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform. usually code is saved in a text file, although with javascript you can also type code directly into a developer console in a browser, which we'll cover shortly.</p>
<p> what is computer language (Syntax) ?</p>
<p>The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called a computer language,sometimes referred to as its syntax</p>
<p>what is statements ?</p>
<p>In a computer language, a group of words,numbers,and operators that performs a specific task is a statement,In Javascript, a statement might look as follows</p>
<pre>
  a = b * 2
</pre>
<p>what is variables ?</p>
<p>The characters a and b are called variables,which are like simple boxes you can store any of your stuff in in programs,variables hold values to be used by the program.think of them as symbolic placeholders for the values themselves. by contrast, the 2 is just a value itself, called a literal value, because it stands alone without being stord in a variable.</p>
<p>what is expressions ? </p>
<p>
  statements are made up of one or more expressions . an expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable and value combined with operators.
  for example :
  <pre>
    a = b * 2
  </pre>
  - 2 is a literal value expression.
  - b is a variable expression,which means to retrieve its current value.
  - b * 2 is an arthmetic expression,which means to do the multiplication.
  - a = b * 2 is an assignment expression,which means to assign the result of the b * 2 expression to the variable a 
  a general expression that stands alone is also called an expression statement,such as the following: 
  <pre>
    b * 2
  </pre>
</p>
